# arox-project

The open source and multi platform programs for Linux, Windows and MacOS. AROS Project - Multiplatform project with a package of programs for specific tasks. There is a program for any task!: Office, gaming, programming and home use! All programs are tested on GNU/Linux and may be unstable on other OS or not run at all. All programs are made in an intuitive design that even a child can understand. Some programs from this homebrew package may only be made for Arch Linux. Also on Wayland or something similar many programs from AROX may not work. Almost all programs were made on the QT framework. Because of this, the programs are most compatible with KDE or other DE written on QT. Some programs were inspired by the programs of the KDE project, especially with the old design. Also for programs it is recommended to use the axugen icon pack for a full understanding of the programs from this package
Many programs from the AROS package will be located on this GitHub: https://github.com/CowerDawn
